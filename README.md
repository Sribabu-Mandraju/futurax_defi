# FuturaX: A Decentralized Prediction Market

## Project Overview

FuturaX is a **blockchain-powered prediction market** that enables users to place stakes on real-world events such as sports, stocks, cryptocurrencies, elections, and entertainment. The platform operates in a **fully decentralized** manner, ensuring transparency, fairness, and security through **smart contracts** that handle staking, fund locking, and automated payouts.

Users can stake cryptocurrency, predict outcomes, and earn rewards upon successful predictions. Since all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, **results are tamper-proof**, and the system remains fully auditable.



## The Problem We Solve

Traditional prediction markets face several fundamental issues that limit their efficiency, trustworthiness, and accessibility:

- **Lack of transparency**: Centralized platforms often manipulate data, restrict access, or introduce biases.
- **High transaction costs**: Middlemen drive up costs, making participation expensive.
- **Limited accessibility**: Regulatory restrictions and regional barriers prevent global participation.
- **Trust issues**: Users must rely on centralized entities to manage the market, leading to risks of fraud or mismanagement.
- **Slow settlement**: Conventional markets take time to validate and resolve outcomes, reducing efficiency.

FuturaX aims to eliminate these inefficiencies by creating a fully decentralized, trustless, and transparent prediction market on the **EDU blockchain**.

## Installation Guide

For developers interested in running the project locally:

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `web` directory.
2. Follow the installation steps in [Frontend README](https://github.com/Sribabu-Mandraju/futureX/blob/main/README.md).

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Follow the installation steps in [Backend README](https://github.com/Sribabu-Mandraju/futureX_backend/blob/main/README.md).

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. Navigate to the `contracts` directory.
2. Follow the instructions in [Contracts README](https://github.com/Nandeesh-D/FutureX-Smart-Contracts/blob/main/README.md).

## Technologies Used

### **Frontend:**

- **React.js** – A modern JavaScript framework for a responsive UI.
- **Wallet Integrations** – Supports MetaMask, WalletConnect, and other Web3 wallets.

### **Smart Contracts:**

- **Solidity** – Defines smart contract logic for staking, payouts, and event resolution.
- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** – Ensures execution consistency across blockchain networks.

### **Blockchain Interactions:**

- **Ethers.js & Web3.js** – Enables seamless communication stakeween the frontend and blockchain.
- **Oracle Services** – Fetches real-world event outcomes to determine winners.



## How It Works

1. **Users Select a Market** – Choose from categories like sports, finance, or politics.
2. **Placing a stake** – Users connect their Web3 wallet and stake cryptocurrency.
3. **Smart Contract Execution** – Funds are securely locked in a smart contract until event resolution.
4. **Result Verification** – Oracle services fetch real-world event outcomes.
5. **Payouts** – The smart contract distributes winnings automatically.

Users can **track their stakes**, view historical predictions, and explore trending markets via an interactive dashboard.



## Staking & Testnet USDC

FuturaX is deployed on the **Sepolia Testnet**, and users must have **USDC tokens** to participate in staking.

🔹 **Get Testnet USDC**: Users can obtain test USDC tokens from the **[Circle Faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/)**. These tokens are required to place stakes on the platform.\
🔹 **Wallet Requirement**: Ensure your wallet is connected to the Sepolia Testnet before proceeding with transactions.

## Use Cases

- 🎯 **Sports staking** – Predict match winners, tournament outcomes, and player performances.
- 📈 **Stock & Crypto Predictions** – stake on **Bitcoin prices, stock trends, and economic events**.
- 🗳 **Political Ev**esearchers and students can analyze prediction trends to understand probabilities and decision-making.**ents** – Predict **election results, policy changes, and geopolitical outcomes**.
- 🎬 **Entertainment** – Wager on **award winners, movie box office performance, and TV show results**.
- 📚 **Educational Insights** – R

## Future Enhancements

🚀 **Live Event Tracking** – Integrate real-time updates for ongoing predictions.\
💰 **DeFi-Backed Loans** – Users can borrow funds against their active stakes.\
🔗 **Cross-Chain Compatibility** – Expanding beyond Ethereum to **Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, and Solana**.\
🗳 **Community Governance (DAO)** – Users vote on platform updates and market categories.\
🎟 **NFT-Based staking Rewards** – Exclusive NFT rewards for top staketors and loyal users.\
🤝 **Social Features** – Enable users to share stakes, discuss predictions, and follow expert traders.
