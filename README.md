# FuturaX: A Decentralized Prediction Market

## Project Overview
FuturaX is a **blockchain-powered prediction market** that enables users to place bets on real-world events such as sports, stocks, cryptocurrencies, elections, and entertainment. The platform operates in a **fully decentralized** manner, ensuring transparency, fairness, and security through **smart contracts** that handle betting, fund locking, and automated payouts.

Users can stake cryptocurrency, predict outcomes, and earn rewards upon successful predictions. Since all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, **results are tamper-proof**, and the system remains fully auditable.

## Installation Guide
For developers interested in running the project locally:

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `web` directory.
2. Follow the installation steps in `web/README.md`.

### Smart Contract Deployment
1. Navigate to the `contracts` directory.
2. Follow the instructions in `contracts/README.md` to deploy Solidity contracts.

## Technologies Used
### **Frontend:**
- **React.js** – A modern JavaScript framework for a responsive UI.
- **Wallet Integrations** – Supports MetaMask, WalletConnect, and other Web3 wallets.

### **Smart Contracts:**
- **Solidity** – Defines smart contract logic for betting, payouts, and event resolution.
- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** – Ensures execution consistency across blockchain networks.

### **Blockchain Interactions:**
- **Ethers.js & Web3.js** – Enables seamless communication between the frontend and blockchain.
- **Oracle Services** – Fetches real-world event outcomes to determine winners.

## How It Works
1. **Users Select a Market** – Choose from categories like sports, finance, or politics.
2. **Placing a Bet** – Users connect their Web3 wallet and stake cryptocurrency.
3. **Smart Contract Execution** – Funds are securely locked in a smart contract until event resolution.
4. **Result Verification** – Oracle services fetch real-world event outcomes.
5. **Payouts** – The smart contract distributes winnings automatically.

Users can **track their bets**, view historical predictions, and explore trending markets via an interactive dashboard.
